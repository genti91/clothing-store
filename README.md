# Clothing Store

This is an e-commerce website for a clothing store made using Next.js framework. Designed with the goal of gaining a deep understanding of Next.js, the website was divided into two separate sections - one for the customers and one for the administrators. The customer-facing website boasts the latest version of Next.js and utilizes the new app directory, along with the sleek styling of Tailwind CSS. Meanwhile, the administrator section of the website is also built on Next.js 13 but uses the pages directory, with a Material UI styling system for a cohesive, professional look. Please note that the project is still ongoing and has yet to be fully completed.
